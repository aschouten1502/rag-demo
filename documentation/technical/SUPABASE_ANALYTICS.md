## 💡 Tips

1. **Performance**: Gebruik WHERE filters op `timestamp` en `event_type` voor snellere queries
2. **Kosten**: Filter altijd op `event_type = 'chat_request'` bij cost analysis (errors hebben geen kosten)
3. **Indexes**: De database heeft indexes op timestamp, language, event_type voor snelle queries
4. **Export**: Gebruik `\copy` in psql of "Download as CSV" in Supabase UI voor exports
5. **Visualisatie**: Integreer met tools zoals Metabase, Grafana, of bouw een custom dashboard
